# Notes   

## Talk1 - Andrews talk on big data in arc via the open tools 
  
- demo
   
  *-video no? 
  
  *-socialjs 
- Tech: 
  - hadoop tools, java api, hive? 
    - images of arcmap 
  - Anvilâ€¦
    - storm 
    - stats / benchmarks
    - geoenrichment or streams 
    - sandy demo with aggregation 
  - Other Demos???
  

##Talk2 

- Github as a geo platform??? 
  - say what? 
  - you crazy
- where the poeple are? Data exhaust as a product of activity   

- Cool libs 
- Need better demo for this? 
- Do i venture down the vector tiles path? 
  - can koop segway into vector tiles? 
  - search indexes on github data / crawling repos for data 
  - open data 

## Talk3 

- open with js.geo? 
  - Spring 2014 / Denver / What do you think? 
  - mention last years success

- demo Cost Distance  

- demo shapefile.js 

- talk about d3? 
  - So d3?
    - paul ramsey quote on d3
    - projections, simplification, binning 

- WAT 
    - ref the guys talk 
    - point out lovely beautiful js-isms 
      - arrays plus objects, etc, etc  

- step back
  - talk about the web a lil bit 

- web evolution
  - browsers get fatter, new technogies, processing tools, and data formats
    - see webgl, css3, web workers, data cubes, binary arrays/buffers 
  - the web becomes life 
    - information dissemination, open data, visualization is really what we seek
  - what is GISs role on the web?

- Javascript is central
  - things like:
    - leaflet, openlayers, and now d3 (svg) 
    - define what we think of in terms of "javascript" 
  - but before we talk JS we have to talk about data and its place on the web 

- the rise of the API 

- data has become pervasive/dynamic
  - network is the bottle neck and we focus on that problem 
  - the q becomes "data delivery"
    - and not only how, but how much data?
  - answer: we start to blur the line between client and server (sockers, webRTC, RestHooks, etc)

- https://vimeo.com/61360229

- so how does GIS (on the Web) adapt to the idea that clients and servers and married to each other  
  - the mass market? 
  - journalism 
  - neocartography

- the rise of Javascript 
  - of course its not new 
  - but when we talk about viz, journalizm, & neocartography 
    - these (in the mass market) imply javascript 
  - the Data Driven GeoWeb?
    - really its just DataDrivenDocs (spatial != special in the mass market)

- The Client is by nature volatile 
  - the perception of what we can / cant do changes 
  - the very nature of the web paradigm, of client/server

- Im not addressing that :)  

- NodeJS............
  - why node? answer that
  - concurrent/evented, streaming I/O  


- Now Code Stuffs!!!

  - JSTS 
      - so in love, but not entirely 
      - insanely in depth, but complicated 
      - growth and adoption are limited
      - can I demo it? .....
      = link: https://github.com/bjornharrtell/jsts
  - Shapely.js 
      https://github.com/chelm/shapely.js
      FAILED, or at least silent 
      
  - Rtree.js 
    link: https://github.com/imbcmdth/RTree

  - Terraformer - indexing / contains in JS
    (demo mixes koop?) Do I need a diagram??? YES a simple omnigraffle
    link: 

  - Link to demo 
     

  - Fun demo time 
    - aggregation visualization 
    - github (storage) 
      -> koop (access/filtering) 
      -> D3 (viz) 
      -> terraformer (indexing & search)
    - compare clustering vs agg 
    - get the sockets demo working 
      - streaming analytics
        - stat rollups etc

Notes - 
  - vector raster as data source, optimize work flow for generation of images in cache
