## Data is Life, and Life is Awesome
### The Data Must Flow

In this time, the most precious substance in the Cyberverse is the data melange. Data extends life. Data expands consciousness. Data is vital to the geospatial industry. APIs and data standards are the tools by which we exchange data. However, there are always going to be new and different standards, different APIs, and new ways of sharing data. [https://github.com/Esri/koop](Koop) is an entirely open source ETL Engine for APIs. Currently Koop is being used in production for Esri's ArcGIS Open Data product, and is being used to drive R&D around visualizating data. In this talk we'll discuss why and how we've built Koop, and how it's given our customers greater power over how they access and share their data and consume data from new places.
