Making pretty things with data

Let's talk maps. Let's talk about data and maps. Also let's talk about making pretty things with data, and what tools we use to make said pretty things. There are so many things to talk about, for reals. This talk will be about how we approach data vizualization problems from the perspective of working with geographic data, and what sort of questions we have to ask ourselves when we big working on a new map. We'll focus on exploring traditional means of structuring data for maps, and touch on what others have done to drive map making to new places. Much respect for open data and hard problems.
