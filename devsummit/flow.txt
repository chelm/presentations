## Exploring Feature Data in JS 

## or chelm's shmorgesborg of JS Fun 

Intro 
  Im chelm 
  Talk about what I do 

Why im giving this talk 

  I like to explore data and find new ways to utilize our services
  to make map compelling viz
  think about how we can bring new concepts into the ArcGIS Platform
  let's drive forward, progress 

Koop 

  background 
    UC -> github as feature services 
    I wrote it 
    Then it became more
    Tons of potential for bringin in new types of data 

  Walkthrough tabs on koop 
    Github -> Koop -> leaflet 
    Socrata, Gist, Climate
    Exporting feature services 
      kml, csv, gpkg, shp    

Demo 

  Find live socrata data and show it off in Socrata, then Koop, then leaflet 
  Access it as a feature service, register in AGOL, perform drive times 
  Wave hands at the potential (load into Desktop and do nearly anything)

Climate Demo 

  We can turn raw data into pretty things 
  GRIB2 data into JSON 
  JSON into GeoJSON into Github (show github clusters)
  Show all the data 
  Vector Tiles
  Gridded interpolation 

  charts? drive charts with the map
  and time do an array of temps
